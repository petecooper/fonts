# Fonts

A selection of free and/or libre fonts. Liable to change.

Not found on Google Fonts at time of commit.

Each font or font family has its own directory, including license information.

Specimen waterfalls are provided.

## How It's Made

* Note: This is just a bunch of notes for me for when I'm having a wonky brain day. If you just want the font files, downlad the .zip and go nuts -- but remember to check the relevant license(s) to see what you're allowed to do with them. Caveat emptor.

You will need:

* A computer running macOS in some fashion, and the following tools:
 * Font Book (Finder -> Applications -> Utilities)
 * XnConvert
 * ImageOptim
* A heap of patience if your computer is a) one of mine, or; b) as slow as one of mine.
* ~25 gigabytes of free drive space for a full regeneration of waterfalls. I know, it's absurd, but here we are.

Let us begin.

## Adding font(s)

This is the easy part, and is relatively brisk:

* Check the license permits intended use, including redistribution.
* Check the font files are not available on Google Fonts.
* Obtain current release or latest build of said font as an archive.
* Preview the font(s) -- do they still look good? Were the designers sneaksy with their fancy previews?
* Install font(s) via Font Book, in the User Fonts folder. We don't need to vandalise the file system with our new precious things.
* Drag new font(s) to `petecooper-fonts` collection. This naming is optional if you're not me. You do you, OK?

## (Re)generating font waterfall(s)

This part is still quite easy, but patience is needed.

* Turn off cloud, network and local backups since we're battering the desktop with some large files and this isn't a fast process.
* Select the font(s) in `petecooper-fonts` collection, ideally just the new ones but if you're feeling particularly sadistic you can select them all.
* Cmd+P to open the print dialog, then follow the settings as laid out in the `/tools/waterfall pdf output settings.png` file.
* Drop the created PDF onto `/tools/fonts waterfall pdf to png then xnconvert.app`, then allow some time for the PDF to make a lot of PNGs.
  * Optional step: do literally anything while this is underway, it can take many minutes.
* While this PDF to PNG magic is munching your CPU time, open XnConvert and apply the settings file from `/tools/xnconvert for waterfall png.xbs` using the XnConvert Actions panel and the diskette icon.
* When you have notification that the PDF to PNG stuff is complete, XnConvert will load the created PNGs into its input bin.
* Use the Convert button in XnConvert to make chonky PNGs. They will overwrite the originals on the desktop and be grotesquely huge in megabytes.
  * Optional step: do literally anything while this is underway, it can take many more minutes than the previous thing that took many minutes.
* While XnConvert is chewing through its workload, open ImageOptim and apply the settings as shown in `/tools/imageoptim settings - general.png`, `/tools/imageoptim settings - quality.png` & `/tools/imageoptim settings - optimisation level.png`.
  * Yes, I'm using Insane optimisation on PNGs that XnConvert exported with zero compression. Fite me.
* Drag the XnConvert'd PNGs into ImageOptim and wait an order of magniture more minutes than the previous thing that was already quite a lot of minutes.
  * This will seem like a week but is actually just a few hours of your life that you won't get back. Consider doing the job you've been putting off for a while, it'll feel good when it's done.
* Rename the PNGs to something sensible and drop into the respective waterfall directory. Accept that you spending time and compute cycles squeezing bytes from files is for the greater good, and the internet tubes will be less busy as a result. Yay.

That's it. Thanks for playing.
