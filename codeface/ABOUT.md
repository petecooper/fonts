## About Codeface

Codeface is a gallery and repository of monospaced fonts for developers.  Fonts displayed in the [main gallery](README.md), [bitmap gallery](BITMAP.md), and [CJK gallery](CJK.md) are distributed through this repository.  The font name link will open the respective font directory where you can download fonts from each typeface.  This directory also includes the typeface license.

The font archive links on the main gallery page include all fonts in the main gallery and bitmap font gallery collections.  The font archive links on the CJK gallery page include only the fonts included in the CJK gallery.  These font archives are updated with all font updates in the respective galleries.

## Fonts that are Not Distributed by Codeface

Fonts displayed in the [Non-redistribution gallery](NONDISTRIB.md) are free for desktop use; however, their licenses do not permit redistribution through the Codeface repository.  You can use the font name link to open the download page on the respective typeface site.

## Font Licensing

I have made every effort to identify and include licenses associated with the fonts that are distributed in this repository.  In some cases, this involved direct contact with the typeface developers to clarify any licensing issues that might prohibit redistribution in this project.  These licenses are linked below the typeface name in the gallery.  If you are the copyright holder of any font and feel that it has an incorrect license associated with it or this form of redistribution does not meet your license requirements, please let me know and I will rectify this immediately.

## Gallery Image Settings

Gallery images in the main and non-redistribution galleries were automatically generated with the Pygments lexer and Pango/Cairo rendering. This process involved the use of modified versions of Andrew Kensler's Python script available in the scripts directory of the repository.  The typefaces were rendered at 14px.  David van Gemeren contributed custom [dark](https://github.com/burodepeper/minimal-syntax-dark) and [light](https://github.com/burodepeper/minimal-syntax) syntax highlighter themes that are used on the main gallery and non-redistribution gallery pages as well as to the automated font specimen image generator code base.

The bitmap font gallery images were manually prepared using screenshots of the typefaces in Sublime Text at recommended font sizes for the respective bitmap fonts.  The syntax highlighters for the bitmap specimens are [Spacegrey Light and Dark](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray) by Gadzhi Kharkharov and contributors.

CJK gallery images were generated as eps files using the open source [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/) desktop publishing application.  The confused character specimen (specimen #1) was generated at a font size of 9pt.  The CJK glyph display specimen (specimen #2) was generated at a font size of 14pt.  Screenshots were taken of these full size eps images.

PNG image compression was performed with the open source [pngquant](https://github.com/pornel/pngquant) and [ImageOptim](https://github.com/pornel/ImageOptim) applications.
